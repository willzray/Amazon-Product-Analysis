# Project Topic: Amazon-Product-Analysis
My very first project I worked on as a Data Analyst. I will be analysing product and customer review data to generate insights that can 
guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

## Project Overview
This data analysis project aimed to uncover insights from customer purchase behavior over the first two quarters of 2025. Using transactional data from the companyâ€™s e-commerce platform, we sought to identify sales trends, high-performing products, customer segments, and potential areas for marketing and operational improvements.
